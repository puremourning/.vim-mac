# .pyclewn_keys.simple file
#
# The default placement for this file is $CLEWNDIR/.pyclewn_keys.simple, or
# $HOME/.pyclewn_keys.simple
#
# Key definitions are of the form `KEY:COMMAND'
# where the following macros are expanded:
#    ${text}:   the word or selection below the mouse
#    ${fname}:  the current buffer full pathname
#    ${lnum}:   the line number at the cursor position
#
# All characters following `#' up to the next new line are ignored.
# Leading blanks on each line are ignored. Empty lines are ignored.
#
# To tune the settings in this file, you will have to uncomment them,
# as well as change them, as the values on the commented-out lines
# are the default values. You can also add new entries. To remove a
# default mapping, use an empty GDB command.
#
# Supported key names:
#       . key function: F1 to F20
#             e.g., `F11:continue'
#       . modifier (C-,S-,M-) + function key
#             e.g., `C-F5:run'
#       . modifier (or modifiers) + character
#             e.g., `S-Q:quit', `C-S-B:info breakpoints'
#
# Note that a modifier is required for non-function keys. So it is not possible
# to map a lower case character with this method (use the Vim 'map' command
# instead).
#
# C-B : break ${fname}:${lnum}   # set breakpoint at current line
# C-K : clear ${fname}:${lnum}   # clear breakpoint at current line
# C-P : print ${text}            # print value of selection at mouse position
# C-Z : interrupt                # interrupt the execution of the target
# S-C : continue
# S-Q : quit
# S-S : step
